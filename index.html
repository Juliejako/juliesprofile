			<h1>Hello, I'm Julie</h1>
			<img src="images/profile-picture.jpg" alt="Julie Jakobowicz" 	id="profile-picture">
			<p id="text-black1">If I had to describe myself with three words I would say I am open, creative and I love to communicate. My openess comes from the fact that I am interested in everything and everyone without any judgement ever. My creativity comes from my dad.</p>

			<P id="text-black2">Since I was very young, I've always loved to write. Thanks to my studies, I ended up discovering a thousand ways to be creative while studying. Who whould have thought that coding includes creativity?
			I am glad I have found a new way to have fun while creating a website. And finally, I love to communicate. For me this is one of the most important values in the world to make relationships of any kind.</p>

			<h2 class="header-purple">Art <span style='font-size:16px;'>&#9978;</span></h2>
			<p id="text-black3">I started to enjoy art since I was a child. Drawing, painting, creating was my way of escaping this world. I stopped for a few years but I recently felt the urge to start again. I drew, painted and created. I felt whole.

			<h2 class="header-purple">Football <span style='font-size:16px;'>&#9917;</span></h2>
			<p id="text-black4">I started to play football when I was 9 or 8. I've always liked the fact to play with a team. I played for over five years and that's where I met one of the most amazing persons in my life. Playing football enabled me to meet my best friend and to learn that sometimes in life, being together makes us stronger.

			<h2 class="header-purple">Write a book <span style='font-size:16px;'>&#10002;</span></h2>
			<p id="text-black5">I've always loved to write. Of course I could have said that within the art section. But for me, writing is very special. With a father who wrote over five books a year, I've always been fascinated by this way of expressing oneself. One of my goals in life is to write a book
